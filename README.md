### SOL
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/e8178eef/openbmc/sol-webui.png">

The Serial over LAN (SoL) console redirects the output of the serverâ€™s serial port to a browser window on your workstation.

This is a patch for enabling SOL in [phosphor-webui](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-webui) on Nuvoton's NPCM750.

The patch provides the [obmc-console](https://github.com/openbmc/obmc-console) configuration.

It's verified with Nuvoton's NPCM750 solution (which is referred as Poleg here) and Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.

**How to use**

1. Prepare a Poleg EVB with up-to-date boot block, Uboot and OpenBMC versions with this SOL patch applied.  Check with Nuvoton support for the most recent versions.

2. Prepare a Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0 motherboard and a LPC cable.
    > _The UEFI firmware version in Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0 for verification is 2.15.1234._

3. Connect pins of the **JTPM** header on **Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0** to the **J10** header on **Poleg EVB** with the LPC cable:
    * Connect **pin 1-3, 5, 7-8, 10-12, 15-17** of JTPM with corresponding pins of J10, **one on one**.
  
4. Steps to copy UEFI SOL related drivers to a USB drive.  

    * Format the USB drive in FAT or FAT32.  
    * Download PolegSerialDxe.efi and TerminalDxe.efi from  [https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc-uefi-util/tree/npcm7xx_v2.1/sol_binary](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc-uefi-util/tree/npcm7xx_v2.1/sol_binary) and copy them to the USB drive.

5. Power up the Poleg EVB and steps to prepare a working terminal for Poleg:

    * Download and install the USB-to-UART driver from: [http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm) according to the host OS in your workstation.  
    * Connect a micro usb cable from your workstation to J2 header of Poleg EVB.  
    * Wait for the FTDI driver to be installed automatically. The COM port number is assigned automatically.  
    * Open a terminal (e.g., Tera Term version 4.87) and set the correct COM port number assigned by the FTDI driver (in previous step).  
    * The COM port should be configured as follows: **115200, 8 bit, 1 stop-bit, no parity, no flow control**.  
    * Press and release the **PWR-ON-RST (SW3)** button to issue a Power-On-reset.  It's expected to see messages output by Poleg on the terminal. Use the following login name/password to login into Poleg.
        * Login name: **root**  
        * Login password: **0penBmc**  

6. Steps to configure Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0 UEFI setting for SOL:

    * Do not plug any bootable device into Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.  
    * Power up Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0 and boot into UEFI setting.  
    * Navigate to `Super IO Concifugration` in `Advanced` menu option and enter into `Super IO Concifugration`.  
    * Configure serial port 1 to **IO=3E8h; IRQ=5**, and then disable it.  
    * Go back to the main UEFI setting.  
    * Navigate to `Boot` menu option and select `UEFI: Built-in EFI Shell` as Boot Option #1.  
      + Make sure that the rest boot options are set to **Disabled**.  
    * Navigate to `Exit` menu option and select `Save changes and Reset`.  
    * Press `Yes` in the prompt window and it will reboot then.  
    * Wait for Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0 to boot into UEFI shell.  
    * Plug the USB drive prepared in step-4 into Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0's usb slot.  
    * Input the following command at UEFI shell prompt, press enter key and it will route to UEFI shell again.  
      ```
      exit  
      ```
    * Check the device mapping table of the USB drive in UEFI shell. It is **fs0:** here for example.  
    * Input the following command at UEFI shell prompt, press enter key and the prompt will show **fs0:\>** from now.  
      ```
      fs0:  
	    ```

## System

### User Management
  * LDAP

### Time
  * **SNTP**  
  	Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks.
    
    **systemd-timesyncd** is a daemon that has been added for synchronizing the system clock across the network. It implements an **SNTP (Simple NTP)** client. This daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with **systemd-networkd** to only operate when network connectivity is available.
        
    The modification time of the file **/var/lib/systemd/timesync/clock** indicates the timestamp of the last successful synchronization (or at least the **systemd build date**, in case synchronization was not possible).
    
    **Source URL**
    * [https://github.com/systemd/systemd/tree/master/src/timesync](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/tree/master/src/timesync)
    
    **How to use**  
    <img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/f38b505/openbmc/ntp.png">
    * Enable NTP by **Web-UI** `Server configuration`  
      ->`Date and time settings`
    * Enable NTP by command  
      ```
      timedatectl set-ntp true  
      ```
      >_timedatectl result will show **systemd-timesyncd.service active: yes**_ 

      If NTP is Enabled and network is Connected (Using **eth2** connect to router), we will see the item **systemd-timesyncd.service active** is **yes** and **System clock synchronized** is **yes**. Thus, system time will sync from NTP server to get current time.
    * Get NTP status  
      ```
      timedatectl  
      ```
      >_Local time: Mon 2018-08-27 09:24:51 UTC  
      >Universal time: Mon 2018-08-27 09:24:51 UTC  
      >RTC time: n/a  
      >Time zone: n/a (UTC, +0000)  
      >**System clock synchronized: yes**  
      >**systemd-timesyncd.service active: yes**  
      >RTC in local TZ: no_  
      
    * Disable NTP  
      ```
      timedatectl set-ntp false  
      ```
      >_timedatectl result will show **systemd-timesyncd.service active: no**_  
      
    * Using Local NTP server Configuration  
    When starting, systemd-timesyncd will read the configuration file from **/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf**, which looks like as below: 
        >_[Time]  
        >\#NTP=  
        >\#FallbackNTP=time1.google.com time2.google.com time3.google.com time4.google.com_  
	
    	By default, systemd-timesyncd uses the Google Public NTP servers **time[1-4].google.com**, if no other NTP configuration is available. To add time servers or change the provided ones, **uncomment** the relevant line and list their host name or IP separated by a space. For example, we setup NB windows 10 system as NTP server with IP **192.168.1.128**  
        >_[Time]  
        >**NTP=192.168.1.128**  
    	>\#FallbackNTP=time1.google.com time2.google.com time3.google.com time4.google.com_

    * Poleg connect to local NTP server of windows 10 system  
      Connect to NB through **eth0** EMAC interface, and set static IP **192.168.1.15**  

      ```
      ifconfig eth0 up
      ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.15
      ```  
      >_Note: Before that you need to setup your NTP server (192.168.1.128) on Windows 10 system first_  
      
      Modify **/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf** file on Poleg as we mentioned
        >_[Time]  
        >**NTP=192.168.1.128**_  
      
      Re-start NTP to make effect about our configuration change  
      ```
      systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd.service
      ```  
      Check status of NTP that show already synced to our local time server 
      ```
      systemctl status systemd-timesyncd.service -l --no-pager
      ```  
      >_Status: "Synchronized to time server 192.168.1.128:123 (192.168.1.128)."_  
      
      Verify **Web-UI** `Server overview`->`BMC time` whether sync from NTP server as same as **timedatectl**. (Note: timedatectl time zone default is UTC, thus you will find the BMC time is UTC+8)
      ```
      timedatectl  
      ```
      >_Local time: Thu 2018-09-06 07:24:16 UTC

  * **Time settings**  
    **Phosphor-time-manager** provides two objects on D-Bus
      >_/xyz/openbmc_project/time/bmc  
      >/xyz/openbmc_project/time/host_  

      **BMC time** is used by journal event log record, and **Host time** is used by Host do IPMI Set SEL Time command to sync BMC time from Host mechanism in an era of BMC without any network interface.  
      Currently, we cannot set Host time no matter what we use **busctl**, **REST API** or **ipmitool set time set** command. Due to **phosphor-settingd** this daemon set default TimeOwner is BMC and TimeSyncMethod is NTP. Thus, when TimeOwner is BMC that is not allow to set Host time anyway.

      A summary of which cases the time can be set on BMC or HOST

	  Mode      | Owner | Set BMC Time  | Set Host Time
	  --------- | ----- | ------------- | -------------------
	  NTP       | BMC   | Fail to set   | Not allowed (Default setting)
	  NTP       | HOST  | Not allowed   | Not allowed
	  NTP       | SPLIT | Fail to set   | OK
	  NTP       | BOTH  | Fail to set   | Not allowed
	  MANUAL    | BMC   | OK            | Not allowed
	  MANUAL    | HOST  | Not allowed   | OK
	  MANUAL    | SPLIT | OK            | OK
	  MANUAL    | BOTH  | OK            | OK

      If user would like to set Host time that need to set Owner to SPLIT in NTP mode or set Owner to HOST/SPLIT/BOTH in MANUAL mode. However, change Host time will not effect BMC time and journal event log timestamp.

	**Set Time Owner to Split**
	```
	### With busctl on BMC
    busctl set-property xyz.openbmc_project.Settings \
       /xyz/openbmc_project/time/owner xyz.openbmc_project.Time.Owner \
       TimeOwner s xyz.openbmc_project.Time.Owner.Owners.Split

	### With REST API on remote host
	curl -c cjar -b cjar -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X  PUT  -d \
       '{"data": "xyz.openbmc_project.Time.Owner.Owners.Split" }' \
       https://${BMC_IP}/xyz/openbmc_project/time/owner/attr/TimeOwner
	```
	**TimeZone**  
    According OpenBMC current design that only support UTC TimeZone now, we can use below command to get current support TimeZone on Poleg
    ```
    timedatectl list-timezones
    ```

### Sensor
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/e1d1733/openbmc/sensor.png">  

[phosphor-hwmon](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-hwmon) daemon will periodically check the sensor reading to see if it exceeds lower bound or upper bound . If alarm condition is hit and event generating option is on, it calls [phosphor-logging](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-logging) API to generate a **Log entry**.  
Later on, ipmi tool on host side can send IPMI command to BMC to get SEL events, [phosphor-host-ipmid](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-host-ipmid) will convert the **Log entries** to SEL record format and reply to host.

* **Configure sensor and event generator**

  * Add Inventory of Sensors

     **Inventory of Sensors** is a map table that defines all types of SEL event BMC can generate. It is constructed from a yaml file, [recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-inventory-sel/config.yaml](https://github.com/openbmc/meta-phosphor/blob/master/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-inventory-sel/config.yaml)  

     Below is a sample **config.yaml** for Poleg EVB:
       ```
       /xyz/openbmc_project/inventory/system:
         sensorID: 0x01
         sensorType: 0x12
         eventReadingType: 0x6F
         offset: 0x02
       /xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/temperature/temp1/critical_high:
         sensorID: 0x02
         sensorType: 0x01
         eventReadingType: 0x01
         offset: 0x09
       /xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/temperature/temp1/critical_low:
         sensorID: 0x02
         sensorType: 0x01
         eventReadingType: 0x01
         offset: 0x02
       /xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/temperature/temp2/critical_high:
         sensorID: 0x03
         sensorType: 0x01
         eventReadingType: 0x01
         offset: 0x09
       /xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/temperature/temp2/critical_low:
         sensorID: 0x03
         sensorType: 0x01
         eventReadingType: 0x01
         offset: 0x02    
       ```
       > _Please refer to  **Sensor and Event Code Tables** in IPMI 2.0 spec for definition of sensorID, sensorType,  eventReadingType, and offset_  
     
     It defines 4 events which could be generated by 2 temperature sensors on Poleg EVB : 

       Name    | SensorID | SensorType  | EventType | Event Description
       ------- | ----- | ------------- | ------------------- | --------
       temp1   | 2  | Temperature   | Threshold | Upper Critical - going high
	   temp1   | 2  | Temperature   | Threshold | Lower Critical - going low
       temp2   | 3  | Temperature   | Threshold | Upper Critical - going high
	   temp2   | 3  | Temperature   | Threshold | Lower Critical - going low
    
  * Add Sensor Configuration File
  
    Each sensor has a [config file](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc/tree/master/meta-evb/meta-evb-nuvoton/meta-evb-npcm750/recipes-phosphor/sensors/phosphor-hwmon%25/obmc/hwmon/ahb/apb) that defines the sensor name and its warning or critical thresholds. These files are located under **recipes-phosphor/sensors/phosphor-hwmon%/obmc/hwmon/apb/**.  

    Below is config for a LM75 sensor on Poleg EVB. The sensor type is **temperature** and its name is **temp2**. It has warning thresholds for **upper** and **lower** bound. The event generating option is also enabled for **WARNHI** and **WARNLO** threshold that forcing the sensor alarm to be recorded in a D-Bus object.
      ```
      LABEL_temp1=temp2
      WARNLO_temp1=28500
      WARNHI_temp1=31000
      EVENT_temp1=WARNHI,WARNLO
      ```

  * Modify D-Bus Sensor Error Metadata interface  
  
    Modify the file [Threshold.metadata.yaml](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/master/xyz/openbmc_project/Sensor/Threshold.metadata.yaml) to determine how to format the meta data of event records, like below : 

      ```
      - name: CriticalHigh
         level: ERR
         meta:
           - str: "SENSOR_DATA=%s"
             type: string
         inherits:
           - xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Callout.Inventory
      - name: CriticalLow
        level: ERR
        meta:
          - str: "SENSOR_DATA=%s"
            type: string
        inherits:
          - xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Callout.Inventory
      ```
    **xyz.openbmc_project.Common.Callout.Inventory** is inherited here in order to include **CALLOUT_INVENTORY_PATH** into phosphor-logging Log entry.

* **Dump events**

  * Using WebUI  
  
    In `Event log` page of **WebUI**, the event may contain a related item like below.
    * **CALLOUT_INVENTORY_PATH** means it has association info in **Inventory of Sensors** table and **/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/temperature/temp2/critical_high** is the key to this map table.  
    * **SENSOR_DATA** is the sensor reading while the event is recorded.  

      ```
       CALLOUT_INVENTORY_PATH=/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/temperature/temp2/critical_high SENSOR_DATA=31000 _PID=2531
      ```

  * Using IPMI
    
    Use IPMI utilities like **ipmitool** to send command for getting SEL records.  
    ```
    $ sudo ipmitool sel list
    
       1 | 10/04/2018 | 07:08:54 | Temperature #0x03 | Lower Critical going low  | Asserted

## IPMI / DCMI

### SOL IPMI
<img align="right" width="30%" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/NTC-CCBG/snapshots/e8178eef/openbmc/sol-ipmi.png">

The Serial over LAN (SoL) via IPMI redirects the output of the serverâ€™s serial port to a command/terminal window on your workstation.

The user uses the ipmi tool like [ipmiutil](http://ipmiutil.sourceforge.net/) to interact with SOL via IPMI. Here the [ipmiutil](http://ipmiutil.sourceforge.net/) is used as an example.

This is a patch for enabling SOL via IPMI using [phosphor-net-ipmid
](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-net-ipmid) on Nuvoton's NPCM750.

The patch integrates [phosphor-net-ipmid](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-net-ipmid) into Nuvoton's NPCM750 solution for OpenBMC.

It's verified with Nuvoton's NPCM750 solution (which is referred as Poleg here) and Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.

**How to use**

1. Please follow instructions from step-1 to step-7 in [SOL](#sol) **How to use** section to configure your workstation, NPCM750 solution and Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.

2. Download the [ipmiutil](http://ipmiutil.sourceforge.net/) according to the host OS in your workstation.
   > _Here it's assumed that the host OS is Windows 7 and ipmiutil for Windows is downloaded and used accordingly._

3. Run SOL:

    * Extract or install the ipmiutil package to a folder in your workstation in advance.  
    * Launch a command window and navigate to that folder.  
    * Input the following command in the command window.  
      ```
      ipmiutil sol -N 192.168.0.2 -U admin -P 0penBmc -J 3 -V 4 -a  
      ```
    * (Optional) If the area doesn't display the UEFI setting clearly, the user could press the **Esc** key once.  
      + It shows a prompt window named `Exit Without Saving`, choose `No` and press enter key to refresh the area for showing UEFI setting entirely.  
    * (Optional) Configure the `Properties` of the command window  to see the entire output of SOL.  
      > _Screen Buffer Size Width: 200_  
        _Screen Buffer Size Height: 400_  
        _Window Size Width: 100_  
        _Window Size Height: 40_

4. End SOL session:

    * Press the "`" key (using the shift key) and "." key at the same time in the command window.  
    * Input the following command in the command window.  
      ```
      ipmiutil sol -N 192.168.0.2 -U admin -P 0penBmc -J 3 -V 4 -d  
      ```
